;;; Commentary:

;; This code is a modified version of emms-info-mp3info.el which
;; has been adapted from code found in mp3player.el.
;; This supports ID3v2 tags using the eyeD3 tool. 

;; To activate this method for getting info, use something like:

;; (require 'emms-info-mp3info)
;; (add-to-list 'emms-info-functions 'emms-info-mp3info)

;;; Code:

(require 'emms-info)
