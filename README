# Intro

These are my customizations for Emacs. Here is the breakdown:

- loadpaths.el adds loadpaths to all the sub-directories that contain
  lisp files.
- init.el loads all the other configuration files in order.
- keybindings.el contains all my custom keybindings.
- theme-conf.el defines my custom theme. Requires color-theme.
- custom-func.el defines custom functions.
- load-modes.el configures major modes.
- calendar-conf.el configures Dutch and Canadian holidays.
- emms-conf.el sets up and configures EMMS.
-- emms-cover.el manages cover images for albums.
-- emms-info-eyed3.el uses eyed3 to read mp3 info tags. Mp3info only
    supports ID3v1.
- gtd-conf.el sets up org-mode, bbdb and remember.
- erc-conf.el starts bitlbee and connects to it with erc.
- .gnus.el -- email setup.
- lunch-break.el adds a hook that puts everything on pause when I eat
  my lunch.
- spacing-algorithm.el  helps me memorize data using a spacing
  algorithm.
- spacing-simple.el frontend for spacing-algorithm that asks questions
  through the minibuffer.
- test-data.el generates random user data.

# Odds and ends

~/.authinfo.gpg contains all my passwords in a netrc format. The file
is encrypted with my private GnuPG key.

~/.covers/ contains the thumbnails for the album covers in the EMMS
browser. The images are downloaded automatically by emms-cover.

~/.emacs.d/snippets/ contains my custom yasnippet snippets.

# Building and updating

I use a lot of libraries that don't come with Emacs and need to be
installed separately. install.sh will checkout the latest source and
build it. None of it is installed however, since I prefer to keep all
of it in my site-lisp.

To update the sources use update.sh.

# package.el packages

I use the following packages from ELPA and Marmelade:

- bitlbee
- color-theme
- flymake-css
- flymake-jslint
- flymake-php
- flymake-shell
- graphviz-dot-mode
- less-css-mode
- lorem-ipsum
- php-mode
- rainbow-mode
- tidy
- twittering-mode
- typopunct
- window-number
- yasnippet
- yasnippet-bundle

I would also like to use csv-mode but it has a syntax error.
